This Vagrant setup can be used to test Percona XtraDB Cluster (Percona Server with Galera)

This is used with Centos 6 x86_64.

If you don't have a Centos 6 base box, you can download mine at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11697684/centos6.box.bz2
This box includes puppet, firewall is disabled and has a nice motd ;)

How to use ?

vagrant up percona1
vagrant up percona2
vagrant up percona3

And this is all, you have now 3 servers running Percona XtraDB Cluster !


These recipes also install GLB (Galera Load Balancer) on percona1.

Note: SElinux is disabled, there is a selinux policy file included that allows the server to start but the other nodes aren't yet able to sync, I need to investigate...
